## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I prioritize documenting and adhering to all project requirements to ensure functionality and security. I implement testing early in development and continue testing throughout the project lifecycle. This proactive approach avoids delays in identifying issues and ensures the code meets functional and security standards.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs begins with thoroughly analyzing and incorporating the client’s requirements into the project. By aligning the program’s features with these requirements, I ensure the solution addresses user needs effectively and supports their goals.

## How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design involves breaking the project into manageable components for better clarity and organization. I ensure all requirements are thoroughly documented and referenced throughout development to guarantee no critical user needs are overlooked. This structured process supports both efficiency and accuracy in delivering a successful solution.
