## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by first making sure that all of the requirements are documented and followed. Then, the code is tested early and throughout the entire project. You can ensure a better sound code by not waiting until the end to run tests.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The ensure needs are within the requirements so by ensuring that you have accounted for all of the client's requirements you are incorporating the user's needs into the project. 

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by breaking each part into sections to better understand my code. I also try to have all of the requirements documented and ready as I am working on a project to help ensure I am not missing a key user need.
